- Evaluated the technical capabilities of SD-WAN products of three companies in order to choose which one to use to upgrade the WAN infrastructure of the ICRC on over 300 sites over the globe and save money by using a more modern technology.
- Ran and developed a test protocol from scratch. The ICRC needed to test that the product works properly on all their sites which have constraints different from the average SD-WAN user (energy limits, slow, unreliable telecommunication, protecting the data from theft from local governments and other armed groups...).

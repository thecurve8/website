- Worked with the Nutritionist team to create digital surveys with Device Magic that are used on the field in communities affected by malnutrition. These surveys, compared to the previous ones on paper, can be personalized instantly according to the situation and save a lot of time for centralizing answers and analyzing the data.
- Developed a database to monitor the COVID-19 related situation in prisons where the ICRC is present. This had to be done with limited resources, as a lot of staff was relocated due to COVID-19 and a lot of travel restrictions were being imposed and in a short time frame as the collected information was used to prioritize emergency operations.

Project with the EPFL Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics.

Used a deep neural network (U-Net) to detect available areas for installations of rooftop solar panels by taking into account possible metastructures on roofs such as windows or chimneys.

No previous work for this specific task can be found in the scientific literature. We manage to achieve a F1-score of 0.77 on real satelitte images.
